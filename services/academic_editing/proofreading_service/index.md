        Choose editing service when your document needs substantive correction
        for grammar, correct words, sentence structure and paragraph
        structure.  Choose proofreading only only if you are sure your
        manuscript has the proper structure and clarity and you want basic
        grammar check to remove misspellings, typographical errors, and
        punctuation errors.
